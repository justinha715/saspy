    "    ```\n",
    "    proc means data=sashelp.fish; run;\n",
    "    proc means data=sashelp.iris; run;\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    \n",
    "    While it would have been fewer keystrokes to submit this directly, the Python code illustrates the general software engineering principle \"Don't Repeat Yourself\" (aka D.R.Y.).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. The same outcome could also have been achieved with the following SAS macro code:\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    %macro loop();\n",
    "        %let dsn_list = fish iris;\n",
    "            %do i = 1 %to 2;\n",
    "                %let dsn = %scan(&dsn_list.,&i.);\n",

    "    %loop\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    \n",
    "  However, note the following differences:\n",
    "   * Python allows us to concisely repeat an arbitrary block of code by iterating over a list using a for-loop. In other words, the body of the for-loop (meaning everything indented underneath it, since Python uses indentation to determine scope) is repeated for each string in the list `['fish','iris'].`\n",
    "   * The SAS macro facility only provides do-loops based on numerical index variables (the macro variable `i` above), so clever tricks like implicitly defined arrays (macro variable `dsn_list` above) need to be used together with functions like `%scan` to extract a sequence of values.\n",
