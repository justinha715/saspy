    "1. To increase performance, only a small number of modules in Python's standard library are available to use directly by default, so the `warnings` and `platform` modules need to be explicitly loaded before use. Python has a large standard library because of its \"batteries included\" philosophy.\n",
    "2. Numerous third-party modules are also actively developed and made freely available through sites like https://github.com/ and https://pypi.org/. Two of the third-party modules needed for this tutorial are pandas, which we'll use for DataFrame objects below, and saspy, which allows Python scripts to connect to a SAS kernel for executing SAS code. Both of these modules come pre-installed with SAS University Edition.\n",
    "3. This example illustrates four ways Python syntax differs from SAS:\n",
    "  * Unlike SAS, capitalization matters in Python. Changing Line 4 to `IMPORT PLATFORM` would produce an error.\n",
    "  * Unlike SAS, semicolons are optional in Python, and they are typically only used to separate multiple statements placed on the same line. E.g., Lines 4-5 could be combined into `import platform; print(platform.sys.version)`\n",
    "  * Unlike SAS, dot-notation has a consistent meaning in Python and can be used to reference objects nested inside each other at any depth. E.g., the `platform` module object invokes the sub-module object `sys` nested inside of it, and `sys` invokes the object `version` nested inside of it. (Think Russian nesting dolls or turduckens.)\n",
    "  * Unlike SAS, single and double quotes always have identical behavior in Python. E.g., `help('modules')` would produce exactly the same results as `help(\"modules\")`.\n",
    "4. If an error is displayed, an incompatible kernel has been chosen. This Notebook was developed using the Python 3.5 kernel provided with SAS University Edition as of January 2020.\n",
